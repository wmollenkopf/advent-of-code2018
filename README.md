Advent of Code 2018 from the site: https://adventofcode.com/2018

A Quick explanation...

Each day is in it's own folder 01, 02, 03 => Day 01, Day 02, Day 03, etc...

In order to run just go to the folder and use the command:
```console
node program.js
```
The input file for each day I used is the file named "input" within each folder.

The code I'm using for these problems are typically "Quick & Dirty" due to personal time constraints.

I may try to come back to these solutions and devise a more elegant, and more optimized solution at a later date.
